Introduction to Machine Learning - Course Overview

Module 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The course covers three main types of learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data to make predictions
   - Linear Regression: Predicting continuous values
   - Classification: Categorizing data into predefined classes
   - Examples: House price prediction, email spam detection

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature space
   - Examples: Customer segmentation, image compression

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and feedback
   - Agent-Environment interaction
   - Reward-based learning
   - Examples: Game playing, robotics

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: Data used to train the model
- Test Data: Data used to evaluate model performance
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model generalization

Popular Algorithms:
- Decision Trees: Tree-based models for classification and regression
- Neural Networks: Inspired by biological neurons
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finding optimal decision boundaries
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classification based on proximity
- Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees

Course Requirements:
- Python programming knowledge
- Basic understanding of statistics and linear algebra
- 8 assignments throughout the semester
- Final project demonstrating ML application
