Dolphins are highly specialized marine mammals that have evolved over millions of years to become masters of their aquatic environment. Because they are adapted entirely for a life spent in water, dolphins do not have any legs; instead, their bodies are streamlined for efficient swimming. Their forelimbs have modified into sleek pectoral flippers used primarily for steering and stability, while powerful propulsion comes from the vertical movement of their muscular tail flukes. Interestingly, although they lack functional hind limbs, evidence of their terrestrial evolutionary past exists in the form of tiny, vestigial pelvic bones still found hidden deep within their bodies.
